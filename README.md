# How to use it

How do you use ZanyZounds? It's easy! Although to get the whole data of ZanyZounds you have to go to the wiki. For example, type "z = [6,6,3,6]" for an example melody number sequence. But then after that, you have to make the sound base and the sound type. Type something like this for the sound base. "s = *ï¿½A>2PX*" is a drum sound base for ZanyZounds. And now for the sound type! For the sound type all you gotta do is just type a sound wave. For example, "t = [NOISE]" would work if you wanted a bit noise sound type. And that's all for today!
